## Methodology
Welcome to the methodology section of our project, where we delve into the intricacies of validating a cutting-edge solution for real-time sound monitoring within IoT networks. In an era where environmental concerns are at the forefront of technological innovation, our focus lies in developing a system that seamlessly integrates into IoT infrastructures, providing invaluable insights into sound dynamics within various environments.

In this section, we meticulously outline the methodology behind our experimentation and simulation endeavors, aimed at rigorously testing the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed solution. Through a series of carefully orchestrated steps, we aim to not only validate the functionality of our system but also lay the groundwork for future advancements in environmental monitoring technology.

### 1. Simulated Environment Setup
Our methodology begins with the establishment of a simulated environment that closely mirrors real-world conditions. This entails configuring a network of five ESP32 microcontrollers, strategically positioned to form an ESP-Now mesh network. Additionally, we integrate high-fidelity microphones into this setup to ensure precise sound signal collection.

### 2. Data Collection and Processing
With our environment set up, we meticulously collect and process sound data using state-of-the-art techniques. Each ESP32 unit is equipped with a high-fidelity microphone, allowing for the conversion of environmental sound waves into digital signals. Through sophisticated algorithms such as Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filtering and A-Weight algorithms, we enhance relevant sound patterns while mitigating unwanted noise, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of our data.

### 3. Connectivity Management
Ensuring seamless communication within our IoT network is paramount to the success of our solution. To achieve this, we employ a robust connectivity management strategy. ESP32 devices are programmed to prioritize direct transmission to a central node, optimizing data transfer efficiency. Moreover, backup routes are implemented to address potential connectivity issues, guaranteeing uninterrupted data flow even in adverse conditions.
